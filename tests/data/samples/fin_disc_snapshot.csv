Comments of Reviewing Officials (public annotations):

PART # REFERENCE COMMENT

N/A N/A General (09/11/2017, Lobeda, Donald G): Filer could not figure out how to sign and submit her report on the
9th of September.

N/A N/A General (09/22/2017, Lobeda, Donald G): Filer's PD (uploaded into Integrity Documents) indicates she is a
Schedule C but the position is SES level, possibly senior executive.

N/A N/A General (09/22/2017, Lobeda, Donald G): Filer is Chief of Staff for the Under Secretary of the Food Nutrition
and Consumer Services (FNCS)

N/A N/A General (11/08/2017, Lobeda, Donald G): Reviewer concluded that although filer has a financial interest
stemming from her anticipated matching contribution from NGA in March 2018, there did not appear
to be any potential that she would be personally and substantially involved in any matter that could
have a direct and predictable impact on the matching contribution as the contribution is a function of
factors unrelated to her USDA duties. Reviewer also concluded that this payment, if received, is not
an extraordinary payment as that term is defined in 5 CFR 2635.503(b)(1).

1. 1 National Grocers Association -
Arlington, Virginia

(11/08/2017, Lobeda, Donald G): Filer has recused herself from working on particular matters that
NGA is a party to until July 9, 2018 because of her covered relationship with them stemming from this
employment, unless she is authorized IAW 5 CFR 2635.502(d).

1. 1 National Grocers Association -
Arlington, Virginia

(11/08/2017, Lobeda, Donald G): Because of her Ethics Pledge filer will not communicate with NGA
reps except as allowed by the Pledge. See attached EA.

2. 1 National Grocers Association MPP &
401K plan

(09/21/2017, Lobeda, Donald G): Filer elected to report several assets despite that they did not
exceed the value or income reporting thresholds.

COMMENT

(09/22/2017, Lobeda, Donald G): Filer elected to report several assets despite that they did not
exceed the value or income reporting thresholds. Filer provided reviewer a copy of her mass mutual
statement for this 401k.

(09/22/2017, Lobeda, Donald G): This appears to be an ETF that uses the Russell 2500 Index as a
benchmark. It may be something that Oppenheimer only offers to retirement plan 401ks, that is
unclear..It appears to qualify as an EIF and should not present any conflicts for the filer. Current
holdings are well below the $15k threshold.

(09/22/2017, Lobeda, Donald G): Filer did not report range of husband's salary per reviewer
instructions and guidance on the OGE 278E instructions.

(09/22/2017, Lobeda, Donald G): Filer provide reviewer with a copy of her monthly statement for this
account, covering June 2017.

Pursuant to Delta's travel benefit plan and Officer

During my appointment, I will not exercise my

In addition, in December 2018, Delta will calculate
the travel I took from November 1, 2017 to January
31, 2018 and impute the income into my W2 and pay
my income taxes up to the maximum of my tax
allowance. For travel after January 31, 2018, Delta will
impute the income but not pay my income taxes.

9 Kirkland & Ellis (law firm) Washington,
District of
Columbia

Prior to confirmation, I will receive $16,313.00 from
my former employer. This sum represents ordinary
course income that I earned as a partner in the firm,
but have yet to receive either because the matters
that resulted in the income were recently settled or
are ongoing. The method for calculation of accrued
income at a discounted rate is identical to the
method the firm uses for any other Kirkland & Ellis
partner who has left the firm and asked to have their
payments accelerated for any reason. Apart from
this payment, I have no further payments of any kind
coming from my former firm.

ENDNOTE

While maintaining my affiliation as a professor with Kyungpook National University, I have taken
unpaid leave from the university in order to work in my present position with EXIM.

This is a family owned company that is owned by the filer' spouse and spouse's family. Company has
significantly wound down operations but does retain assets, primarily intellectual property. I am an
LLC Manager with the company and have been past General Counsel.

This is a non-profit entity that is a foundation primarily set up to support religious missionary activities.
It just formed in October 2016. It currently holds no assets and conducts no activities.

This is a company that I have been in the process of helping get started up. I've been part of the
unpaid, entrepreneurial management team. I resigned my position as unpaid general counsel in early
February 2017, prior to starting my U.S. government position. I maintain my membership interest and
would like to return to some type of permitted management role.

I recurrently worked as a visiting professor at the University of Ljubljana's Faculty of Economics
Summer School.

I was paid by my employer, Kyungpook National University, while visiting the University of Utah. I was

provided and office and other privileges but received no compensation from the University of Utah.

Owned by spouse and spouse's family. Spouse does not take any income. Value represents spouse's
interest in asset only.

This mortgage was paid off using the funds from the Quicken Loans mortgage in 2016.

Re: Addendum to Financial Disclosure Report of Randal K. Quarles

Dear Ms. Williams:

The purpose of this letter is to correct an inadvertent error in the financial disclosure report that
I signed on June 1, 2017, and amended on September 5, 2017 and October 13, 2017. In
preparing my nominee financial disclosure report, I misread the reporting period for Part 1,
Filer's Positions Held Outside the United States Government. As a result, I omitted my former
position as a member of the board of directors of Avalon Advisors, LLC, from which I resigned
in 2015.

Part I is amended, as follows:

Part 1

Organization Name City/Sta te Organization Position Held From To
Type
Avalon Advisors, LLC Houston, Limited Liability Member, Board of 9/2011 10/2015
Texas Company Directors

I understand that this supplement will be attached to my financial disclosure report and released
upon request with that report.

Summary of Contents

1. Filer's Positions Held Outside United States Government

Part 1 discloses positions that the filer held at any time during the reporting period (excluding positions with the United States Government). Positions are reportable
even if the filer did not receive compensation.

This section does not include the following: (1) positions with religious, social, fraternal, or political organizations; (2) positions solely of an honorary nature; (3) positions

Filer receives a combined director's fee from this entity for his service as a director for the mutual fund
companies named in part 1.

Filer sits on the board of the Money Fund Series, of which this fund is a part. Because of that, this fund

will not qualify as an excepted investment fund; however the underlying holdings of this fund are
publicly available in the company’s prospectus.
Summary of Contents

1. Filer's Positions Held Outside United States Government

Part 1 discloses positions that the filer held at any time during the reporting period (excluding positions with the United States Government). Positions are reportable
even if the filer did not receive compensation.

This section does not include the following: (1) positions with religious, social, fraternal, or political organizations; (2) positions solely of an honorary nature; (3) positions
held as part of the filer's official duties with the United States Government; (4) mere membership in an organization; and (5) passive investment interests as a limited
partner or non -managing member of a limited liability company.

2. Filer's Employment Assets & Income and Retirement Accounts

Part 2 discloses the following:

● Sources of earned and other non -investment income of the filer totaling more than $200 during the reporting period (e.g., salary, fees, partnership share,
honoraria, scholarships, and prizes)
● Assets related to the filer's business, employment, or other income -generating activities that (1) ended the reporting period with a value greater than $1,000 or (2)
produced more than $200 in income during the reporting period (e.g., equity in business or partnership, stock options, retirement plans/accounts and their
underlying holdings as appropriate, deferred compensation, and intellectual property, such as book deals and patents)

This section does not include assets or income from United States Government employment or assets that were acquired separately from the filer's business,
employment, or other income -generating activities (e.g., assets purchased through a brokerage account). Note: The type of income is not required if the amount of
income is $0 - $200 or if the asset qualifies as an excepted investment fund (EIF).

3. Filer's Employment Agreements and Arrangements

Part 3 discloses agreements or arrangements that the filer had during the reporting period with an employer or former employer (except the United States
Government), such as the following:

● Future employment

● Continuing participation in an employee welfare, retirement, or other benefit plan, such as pensions or a deferred compensation plan

● Retention or disposition of employer -awarded equity, sharing in profits or carried interests (e.g., vested and unvested stock options, restricted stock, future share of
a company's profits, etc.)

4. Filer's Sources of Compensation Exceeding $5,000 in a Year

Part 4 discloses sources (except the United States Government) that paid more than $5,000 in a calendar year for the filer's services during any year of the reporting
period.
The filer discloses payments both from employers and from any clients to whom the filer personally provided services. The filer discloses a source even if the source
made its payment to the filer's employer and not to the filer. The filer does not disclose a client's payment to the filer's employer if the filer did not provide the services
for which the client is paying.

5. Spouse's Employment Assets & Income and Retirement Accounts

Part 5 discloses the following:

● Sources of earned income (excluding honoraria) for the filer's spouse totaling more than $1,000 during the reporting period (e.g., salary, consulting fees, and
partnership share)

● Sources of honoraria for the filer's spouse greater than $200 during the reporting period

● Assets related to the filer's spouse's employment, business activities, other income -generating activities that (1) ended the reporting period with a value greater
than $1,000 or (2) produced more than $200 in income during the reporting period (e.g., equity in business or partnership, stock options, retirement plans/accounts
and their underlying holdings as appropriate, deferred compensation, and intellectual property, such as book deals and patents)

This section does not include assets or income from United States Government employment or assets that were acquired separately from the filer's spouse's business,
employment, or other income -generating activities (e.g., assets purchased through a brokerage account). Note: The type of income is not required if the amount of
income is $0 - $200 or if the asset qualifies as an excepted investment fund (EIF). Amounts of income are not required for a spouse's earned income (excluding
honoraria).

PART # ENDNOTE

2. 1 The 401K is a defined contribution plan, fully vested at all times. The plan is administered by Fidelity.
All my assets were invested in the Pimco Total Return Bond Fund.

2. 2 I was a partner of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, LLP until May 16, 2009. Pursuant to the partnership
agreement, upon withdrawing from the firm, I receive a payment in respect of prior service which is
equal to a percentage fixed by the partnership agreement of the average of my income from the firm
in 2006, 2007 and 2008, which amount is then reduced by a percentage that limits the amount of total
firm retirement payments for the payment period. This is being paid in quarterly installments over ten
years, commencing with the quarter ending September 30, 2009.

ENDNOTE

I was a partner of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, LLP until May 16, 2009. Pursuant to the partnership
agreement, upon withdrawing from the firm, I receive a payment in respect of prior service in quarterly
installments over ten years, commencing with the quarter ending September 30, 2009.

Our Utah 529 Savings Plan Account was invested in the following Vanguard funds: Institutional Index
Fund Plus (50%); Mid -cap Index Fund (20%); Small -cap Index Fund (20%); and International Stock Fund
(10%).

This is an investment partnership that was available to partners of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, LLP and
certain affiliated persons and entities, and I invested during the time I was a partner. The funds were
placed with third -party private equity managers who had sole investment authority. The commitment
period has expired and no new investments will be made. Cravath has provided me with the
estimated value and income as well as the information as to the underlying investments and their
sectors, which today consist only of a common stock holding in Prince Mineral Holding Corporation
(manufacturer of iron and manganese compounds).

My parents established two trusts, the Delores R Massad Descendants Trust and the Alex H Massad
Descendants Trust, for the benefit of their children and grandchildren. I resigned as a trustee of both
trusts in November 2013. The Alex H Massad Descendants Trust was divided in 2014 following my
father's death into three trusts, one for each of his children (and their descendants); my interest is
now only in the Timothy Massad Lifetime Trust. I have no control over the investments of either the
Delores R Massad Descendants Trust or the Timothy Massad Lifetime Trust. Based on the information
provided to me as a beneficiary, I have disclosed my interest in the trusts assets in items 43.1 through
43.11 plus items 71 through 73. Item 43.11 is a minority limited partnership interest in a partnership
created by my parents. My mother owns a majority of the limited partnership interests in the
partnership as well as the general partnership interest. She has the right to substitute other assets for
the interests in the partnership held by the trusts. I have no control over the investments of the
partnership. Based on the information provided to me in 2013 prior to my resignation as a trustee of
the trusts, I have disclosed my interest in the trusts' interests in the investments of the partnership in
items 43.11.1 through 43.11.72.

This is an investment of the trusts listed in item 43. See end note to item 43.
