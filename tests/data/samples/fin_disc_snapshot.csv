Re: Addendum to Financial Disclosure Report of Mark Esper

Dear Ms. Vetter:

The purpose of this letter is to correct inadvertent errors in the financial disclosure report that
I signed on June 12, 2017. The items identified below are amended, as follows:

Part 2

Description               EIF  Value       Income Type      Income Amount
Raytheon Company          N/A              Salary/Bonus     $914,658
Raytheon Company (Stock)  N/A  $100,001 -  Capital Gains /  $15,001450.000
                               $250,000    Dividends

I understand that this supplement will be attached to my financial disclosure report and released
upon request with that report.

Sincerely,

S.

benefits associated with United States Government employment (e.g., Thrift Savings Plan); and (3) cash accounts (e.g., checking, savings, money market accounts) at a

Comments of Reviewing Officials (public annotations):

PART # REFERENCE COMMENT

N/A N/A General (09/11/2017, Lobeda, Donald G): Filer could not figure out how to sign and submit her report on the
9th of September.

N/A N/A General (09/22/2017, Lobeda, Donald G): Filer's PD (uploaded into Integrity Documents) indicates she is a
Schedule C but the position is SES level, possibly senior executive.

N/A N/A General (09/22/2017, Lobeda, Donald G): Filer is Chief of Staff for the Under Secretary of the Food Nutrition
and Consumer Services (FNCS)

N/A N/A General (11/08/2017, Lobeda, Donald G): Reviewer concluded that although filer has a financial interest
stemming from her anticipated matching contribution from NGA in March 2018, there did not appear
to be any potential that she would be personally and substantially involved in any matter that could
have a direct and predictable impact on the matching contribution as the contribution is a function of
factors unrelated to her USDA duties. Reviewer also concluded that this payment, if received, is not
an extraordinary payment as that term is defined in 5 CFR 2635.503(b)(1).

1. 1 National Grocers Association -
Arlington, Virginia

(11/08/2017, Lobeda, Donald G): Filer has recused herself from working on particular matters that
NGA is a party to until July 9, 2018 because of her covered relationship with them stemming from this
employment, unless she is authorized IAW 5 CFR 2635.502(d).

1. 1 National Grocers Association -
Arlington, Virginia

(11/08/2017, Lobeda, Donald G): Because of her Ethics Pledge filer will not communicate with NGA
reps except as allowed by the Pledge. See attached EA.

2. 1 National Grocers Association MPP &
401K plan

(09/21/2017, Lobeda, Donald G): Filer elected to report several assets despite that they did not
exceed the value or income reporting thresholds.

COMMENT

(09/22/2017, Lobeda, Donald G): Filer elected to report several assets despite that they did not
exceed the value or income reporting thresholds. Filer provided reviewer a copy of her mass mutual
statement for this 401k.

(09/22/2017, Lobeda, Donald G): This appears to be an ETF that uses the Russell 2500 Index as a
benchmark. It may be something that Oppenheimer only offers to retirement plan 401ks, that is
unclear..It appears to qualify as an EIF and should not present any conflicts for the filer. Current
holdings are well below the $15k threshold.

(09/22/2017, Lobeda, Donald G): Filer did not report range of husband's salary per reviewer
instructions and guidance on the OGE 278E instructions.

(09/22/2017, Lobeda, Donald G): Filer provide reviewer with a copy of her monthly statement for this
account, covering June 2017.

(09/22/2017, Lobeda, Donald G): Estimated market value 6/30/2017- $16818.75.

(09/22/2017, Lobeda, Donald G): Estimated market value 6/30/2017- $12299.85.

(09/22/2017, Lobeda, Donald G): Estimated market value 6/30/2017- $18899.12. National Beverage
Corp. offers a wide selection of flavored soft drinks, juices, sparkling waters, energy drinks and
nutritionally–enhanced waters to a diverse customer base in North America. Brands include
Everfresh, Shasta, LaCroix, RipIt, Big Shot, Asante, and others.

with The Suburban Collection, along with all other
outside positions. I will remain a passive investor in
The Suburban Collection and perform no services for
the production of income. Following my resignation
from the company, I may enter into a separate
agreement with The Suburban Collection for a fixed
annual fee based on the prevailing market rate for
use of secretarial and IT support and equipment for
personal activities, use of a plane or motor vehicle,
and health insurance benefits for myself and my
family. If I enter into an agreement with The
Suburban Collection or any other entity for additional
services, such as use of a motor vehicle, I will pay fair
market value for these additional services. I will
continue to participate in The Suburban Collection
defined contribution plan but neither The Suburban
Collection nor any other company will make
contributions after my separation.

Prior to confirmation, I will receive $16,313.00 from
my former employer. This sum represents ordinary
course income that I earned as a partner in the firm,
but have yet to receive either because the matters
that resulted in the income were recently settled or
are ongoing. The method for calculation of accrued
income at a discounted rate is identical to the
method the firm uses for any other Kirkland & Ellis
partner who has left the firm and asked to have their
payments accelerated for any reason. Apart from
this payment, I have no further payments of any kind
coming from my former firm.

ENDNOTE

While maintaining my affiliation as a professor with Kyungpook National University, I have taken
unpaid leave from the university in order to work in my present position with EXIM.

This is a family owned company that is owned by the filer' spouse and spouse's family. Company has
significantly wound down operations but does retain assets, primarily intellectual property. I am an
LLC Manager with the company and have been past General Counsel.

This is a non-profit entity that is a foundation primarily set up to support religious missionary activities.
It just formed in October 2016. It currently holds no assets and conducts no activities.

This is a company that I have been in the process of helping get started up. I've been part of the
unpaid, entrepreneurial management team. I resigned my position as unpaid general counsel in early
February 2017, prior to starting my U.S. government position. I maintain my membership interest and
would like to return to some type of permitted management role.

I recurrently worked as a visiting professor at the University of Ljubljana's Faculty of Economics
Summer School.

I was paid by my employer, Kyungpook National University, while visiting the University of Utah. I was

provided and office and other privileges but received no compensation from the University of Utah.

Part 4 discloses sources (except the United States Government) that paid more than $5,000 in a calendar year for the filer's services during any year of the reporting
period.
The filer discloses payments both from employers and from any clients to whom the filer personally provided services. The filer discloses a source even if the source

honoraria).

6. Other Assets and Income

Part 6 discloses each asset, not already reported, that (1) ended the reporting period with a value greater than $1,000 or (2) produced more than $200 in investment
