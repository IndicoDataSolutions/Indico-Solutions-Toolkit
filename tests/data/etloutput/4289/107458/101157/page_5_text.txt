model_id	int	Prediction. Model. Id 7
5 Predictions do not have a system-assigned unique identifier. Recommended that the integration pulling this data
generates a unique UUIDv7 for each prediction.
6 For performance reasons, this column should have an index. Depending upon the DBMS, this column may need to
be normalized out, hashed, or otherwise converted to an indexable type.
7 Based on the Result File classes in the Indico Toolkit (available in Python and C# versions).
8 As predictions do not have a system-assigned unique identifier, predicted values and reviewed values must be
matched by similarity within the integration. An example of doing so is available in the Indico-developed
groundtruth program.
Scheduled Process Logic
This is a heavyweight query tied to submissions. Because predictions have no system-assigned unique
identifier, and the identifier assigned by the integration is not stable, predictions must be pulled only once
per submission. This should occur at the terminal state of the submission just before it's omitted from future
processing: i.e. when the submission is marked as retrieved. Once a submission is marked as retrieved,
there should be no further updates to the submission resetting its updatedAt attribute, therefore it will be
omitted from all future runs of the integration.
Data Reconciliation
The output does not include a primary key needed to update existing rows. As such it will only contain new
rows to be inserted into the Metrics database.
