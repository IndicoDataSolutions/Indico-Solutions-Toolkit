Indico Metrics Integration Data Model
This document covers the intermediate data model used to pull Data Intake metrics
from Indico to be aggregated and displayed within Metrics.
Contents
This document assumes that a single integration process is run on a schedule and
uses 4 discrete GraphQL queries to download low-level metrics using the Indico
GraphQL API. Scheduling recommendations are provided below.
These metrics are lightly processed and denormalized to match the intermediate
data model defined below. The integration will produce data in a consumable
format, such as SQL UPSERT
queries, an importable CSV file, or an importable
JSON file.
1 Entities
1.1 Workflow
1.2 Model
1.3 Submission
1.4 Submission File
1.5 Reviewer
1.6 Prediction
Once imported, Metrics can filter and aggregate the intermediate data as described below to display higher-
level data points to fulfill the reporting requirements defined elsewhere.
1 Entities
1.1 Workflow
Column	Type	GraphQL Source
id	int	workflow.id
name	str	workflow. name
Example GraphQL Query
query Workflows {
workflows {
workflows {
id
name
}
}
}
Scheduled Process Logic
This is a lightweight query. All workflows will be pulled every time the integration is run.
Data Reconciliation
The output will include the primary key id needed to update existing rows and insert new rows into the
Metrics database.
