Example GraphQL Query

submissions(orderBy: UPDATED_BY, desc: true, limit: 1000) {
submissions {
id
createdAt
inputFiles {
id
filename
}
reviews {
createdBy
startedAt
completedAt
rejected
notes
reviewType
}
retrieved
updatedAt
workflowId
}
}
}
Scheduled Process Logic
This is a heavyweight query. Submissions are ordered by updatedAt descending, and results should be
paginated such that processing can stop once all submissions have been processed whose updatedAt
date is greater than the timestamp of the previous run of the integration.
Data Reconciliation
The output will include the primary key id needed to update existing rows and insert new rows into the
Metrics database.
1.4 Submission File
