1 The timestamp for submission processing being completed is not directly available on the submission object.
Instead it's approximated by the completion time of Auto Review in the reviews list
(where reviewType == “AUTO”).
2 The HITL review data points must come from the Manual Review in the reviews list
(where reviewType == “MANUAL”).
3 The time of retrieval is not directly available on the submission object. Instead it's approximated by the last
update time of the submission once the retrieved flag is set.
4 The failure status is not directly available on the submission object as a boolean. Instead it's derived using the
status
of the submission (where status == “FAILED”).
